# JDBC Repository

Welcome to the JDBC Repository! This repository contains Java code for interacting with databases using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity). JDBC is a Java API for connecting and executing SQL queries on a database.

## Features

- **Database Connection:** Establish a connection to your database.
- **CRUD Operations:** Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on database records.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans)
- Database Management System (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```git clone https://github.com/dhruv8433/Java-JDBC/```

2. Import the project into your IDE.

3. Ensure that your database server is running.

4. Configure the database connection properties in ```DriverManager.getConnection```

5. Run the application to test the JDBC functionality.

## Usage

Modify the provided Java classes according to your database schema and requirements. Here's a brief overview of the files:

- `ConnectionDb.java`: Establishes a connection to the database.
- `Insertion.java, Deletion.java`: Data Access Object for performing CRUD operations on the `Registation` table.
- `DisplayTable.java`: Model class representing a user entity.

Feel free to extend and customize the codebase to suit your needs!
